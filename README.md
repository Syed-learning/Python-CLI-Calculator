#  Simple To-Do List (Python CLI)

A simple **command-line To-Do List application** built with Python.  
It uses a **list** to manage tasks, and stores them in a **text file (`tasks.txt`)** so your tasks are **persistent** even after closing the program.

---

##  Features
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks  
- Remove tasks by number  
- Persistent storage (saves tasks in `tasks.txt`)
